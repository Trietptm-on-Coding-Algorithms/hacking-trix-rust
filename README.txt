I wanted to have a repo of (basic) techniques in Rust.

Preferably these would be standalone `.rs` files one can refer to when developing exploits on the fly, like during a CTF. I want to keep the code very slim and straight-to-the-point.

I would love it if others could contribute some of their code! I'm not sure how to organize this repository yet, so please let me know if you have ideas :)
You can reach out to me on Matrix, Twitter, or by Email.

P.S. I know Golang is a great language but this repo is for people who want to write in Rust <3
